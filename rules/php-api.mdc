# PHP API Development Guidelines

## Code Style and Structure
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards for consistent formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper namespace organization
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use type declarations for function parameters and return types

## Error Handling
- Implement proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
- Return consistent error response formats
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks

## API Design
- Follow RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement consistent response formats (JSON)
- Include proper API versioning strategy
- Provide clear and descriptive endpoint documentation

## Performance Optimization
- Use efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Minimize memory usage and avoid memory leaks
- Use appropriate data structures for different use cases
- Profile and optimize slow-performing code

## Data Validation
- Validate input data types and formats
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Use whitelist validation where possible
- Provide clear validation error messages
- Validate file uploads properly (type, size, content)

## Database Interactions
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Use transactions for related database operations
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement proper database error handling

## JSON Response Handling
- Always return valid JSON responses
- Use consistent response structure across endpoints
- Include appropriate metadata (status, message, data)
- Handle JSON encoding/decoding errors gracefully
- Implement proper content-type headers

## File Handling
- Validate file uploads thoroughly
- Implement proper file storage organization
- Use secure file naming conventions
- Implement file size and type restrictions
- Handle file processing errors gracefully

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use code analysis tools for quality checking
- Validate API responses against schemas
- Test error handling scenarios thoroughly

## Documentation
- Document all API endpoints with examples
- Include request/response formats
- Document authentication requirements
- Provide error code explanations
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Monitoring and Logging
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Log API usage and performance metrics
- Monitor error rates and response times
- Use structured logging formats
- Implement proper log rotation and retention
